Done:
1) Very basic HTTP server. We could also swap out this one with an open source 
option and add Rack to sync up pretty easy.
2) Very basic routing. It's not very intelligent, but will recognize a hard route
and execute a block. We don't currently handle dynamic routes.
3) Very basic database connections and migrations. We can create timestamped 
migrations and execute them. When a project is created we also create the 
migration.log file which holds our database name and what migrations have been 
run and at what time. 

TODO: 
1) Would be nice to do some basic templating. 
2) Figure out dynamic routes. 
3) Lots of error handling and general clean up.
